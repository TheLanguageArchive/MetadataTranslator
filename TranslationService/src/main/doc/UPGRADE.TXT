GENERAL

To upgrade from the previous version:

Deploy MetadataTranslator-${project.artifactId}-${project.version}-r${buildNumber}.war 
to the servlet container where MetadataTranslator was previously running. 

In the case of staging deployment on lux17, make sure to re-wire the HandleResolver
implementation. See the installation instructions (step 5.4) for details.

UPGRADING FROM 1.5.0 TO 1.5.1

The following optional context parameter can now be set to specify the URL of a
*client side* stylesheet:

    - 'nl.mpi.translation.imdi2cmdiClientSideStylesheet'

                If present and non-empty, this value gets inserted into a 
                processing instruction in the header of the IMDI to CMDI output.
                Make sure that the specified URL has the SAME SCHEME and SAME 
                HOST as the translation service itself, otherwise the client's 
                browser will most likely reject the stylesheet! The stylesheet
                is typically called 'browser_cmdi2html.xsl'.

UPGRADING FROM 1.4.x TO 1.5.0

The following optional context parameters can now be set to allow for internal
rewriting of public URLs to local file system paths:

        - 'nl.mpi.metadatatranslator.localFilesPublicBaseUrl'

                Defines a base URL for metadata resources that can be read from
                the local filesystem by the translation services (local path to
                be defined in the 'localFilesPathOnFilesystem' parameter).
                Leave out or set to empty to prevent any mapping from public
                URLs to local paths from happening.

        - 'nl.mpi.metadatatranslator.localFilesPathOnFilesystem'

                Defines the base location that corresponds with the base URL
                defined in the 'localFilesPublicBaseUrl' parameter. Should be
                a path, not a URL (i.e. should start with '/', not 'file:'.)
                Leave out or set to empty to prevent any mapping from public
                URLs to local paths from happening.

UPGRADING FROM ANY EARLIER VERSION TO 1.4.x

The following optional context parameters can now be set:

	- 'nl.mpi.metadatatranslator.handleResolutionCacheExpiry'

		It determines the amount of time to keep handle resolution results (in seconds).
		Set to 0 to disable caching. Default value is 600 (ten minutes).
	
	- 'nl.mpi.translation.imdi2cmdiXSLT'
	
		Path on the local file system to the (master) IMDI to CMDI stylesheet. Leave empty
		or unspecified to fall back to internal stylesheet 'imdi2cmdi.xslt'.
	
	- 'nl.mpi.translation.cmdi2imdiXSLT'

		Path on the local file system to the (master) CMDI to IMDI stylesheet. Leave empty
		or unspecified to fall back to internal stylesheet 'cmdi2imdiMaster.xslt'.
		
Using the latter two parameters, stylesheets can be maintained outside the application
context, allowing for fixes and other updates without redeploying the translation service.
To bootstrap this, copy the embedded stylesheets from the 'xslt-templates' directory
in this package. Notice that these are *not* used by the application by default, as it
takes by default the stylesheets packaged as resources in the metadata-translator JAR.
